abstract = {In this work we examine the lunar crater Boguslawsky as a typical region of the illuminated southern lunar highlands with regard to its temperature regime and the behavior of the depth of the water/hydroxyl-related spectral absorption band near 3µm wavelength. For estimating the surface temperature, we compare two different methods, the first of which is based on raytracing and the simulation of heat diffusion in the upper regolith layer, while the second relies on the thermal equilibrium assumption and uses Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M³) spectral reflectance data for estimating the wavelength-dependent thermal emissivity. A method for taking into account the surface roughness in the estimation of the surface temperature is proposed. Both methods yield consistent results that coincide within a few K. By constructing a map of the maximal surface temperatures and comparing with the volatility temperatures of Hg, S, Na, Mg, and Ca, we determine regions in which these volatile species might form stable deposits. Based on M³ data of the crater Boguslawsky acquired at different times of the lunar day, it is found that the average OH absorption depth is higher in the morning than at midday. In the morning a dependence of the OH absorption depth on the local surface temperature is observed, which is no more apparent at midday. This suggests that water/OH accumulates on the surface during the lunar night and largely disappears during the first half of the lunar day. We furthermore model the time dependence of the OH fraction remaining on the surface after having been exposed to the temporally integrated solar flux. In the morning, the OH absorption depth is not correlated with the remaining fraction of OH-containing species, indicating that the removal of water and/or OH-bearing species is mainly due to thermal evaporation after sunrise. In contrast, at midday the OH absorption depth increases with increasing remaining fraction of OH-containing species, suggesting photolysis by solar photons as the main mechanism for removal of the remaining OH-containing species later in the lunar day.}

abstract = {Spacecraft observations of atmosphereless Solar System bodies, combined with thermophysical modeling, provide important information about the thermal inertia and degree of surface roughness of these bodies. The thermophysical models rely on various methods of generating topography, the most common being the concave spherical segment. We here compare the properties of thermal emission for a number of different topographies – concave spherical segments, random Gaussians, fractals and parallel sinusoidal trenches – for various illumination and viewing geometries, degrees of surface roughness and wavelengths. We find that the thermal emission is strongly dependent on roughness type, even when the degrees of roughness are identical, for certain illumination and viewing geometries. The systematic usage of any single topography model may therefore bias determinations of thermal inertia and level of roughness. We outline strategies that may be employed during spacecraft observations to disentangle thermal inertia, level of roughness and type of topography. We also compare the numerically complex and time consuming full-scale thermophysical models with a simplified statistical approach, which is fairly easy to implement and quick to run. We conclude that the simplified statistical approach is similar to thermophysical models for cases tested here, which enables the user to analyze huge amounts of spectral data at a low numerical cost.}

abstract = {This study provides an analysis of the impact melt deposits (melt flows and ponds) associated with eight lunar craters with diameters between 9 and 96km in terms of their topographic, photometric and spectral properties. Our analysis is based on an integrated method for construction of digital elevation models (DEM) of high lateral resolution, pixel-wise photometric modelling, construction of topographically corrected normalised reflectance maps, extraction of spectral parameters and estimation of elemental abundances based on Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) hyperspectral data and data of the Lunar Prospector Gamma Ray Spectrometer instrument. Most of the examined geologically fresh impact melt flows are characterised by lower albedos than the surrounding surface and tend to originate from topographically low parts of the source crater rim. As an exception, we find that the impact melt deposits northeast of crater Aristillus lack any optical signature and are not visible in monochrome images, but can only be observed by their anomalously smooth surface inferred from the DEM. Some impact melt flows and ponds exhibit photometric anomalies in terms of the asymmetries in the single-particle scattering function and the slope of that parameter with respect to wavelength. These photometric anomalies may be due to impact melt specific anomalies of the surface structure, e.g. consolidated rock rather than regolith, or anomalies in size or shape of the geometric surface elements (e.g. individual grains or their aggregates) on submillimetre spatial scales. The strength of the hydroxyl absorption displays a negative anomaly with respect to the surrounding surface for the majority of the examined impact melt flows. As an impact melt specific spectral behaviour, we find a decrease in the absorption band depth around 2000nm and (in several cases) a simultaneous increase of the absorption band depth near 1000nm. These observations are consistent with the laboratory analyses by Tompkins et al. (Tompkins, S., Pieters, C.M. [2010]. Meteorit. Planet. Sci. 45 (7), 1152–1169) of chemically uniformly composed mixtures between crystalline and glass material. For several impact melt flows, their data allow to roughly estimate the fraction of glass material based on our spectral analysis.}

Therefore, a new empirical model, constrained by Diviner data, has been developed based on the correlation of reflectance at 1.55 µm and at 2.54 µm observed in laboratory reflectance spectra of Apollo and Luna soil and glass‐rich samples. Reflectance values at these wavelengths follow a clear power law,

              reflectance data that have been independently corrected by using Diviner‐based temperatures, confirming that this is a general reflectance property of materials that typify the lunar surface. These results demonstrate that reflectance at a thermally affected wavelength (2.54 µm) can be predicted within 2\% (absolute) based on reflectance values at shorter wavelengths where thermal contributions are negligible and reflectance is dominant. Radiance at 2.54 µm that is in excess of the expected amount is assumed to be due to thermal emission and is removed during conversion of at‐sensor radiance to reflectance or I/F. Removal of this thermal contribution by using this empirically based model provides a more accurate view of surface reflectance properties at wavelengths {\textgreater}2 µm, with the benefit that it does not require independent measurements or modeling of surface temperatures at the same local time as M

              data were acquired. It is demonstrated that this model is appropriate for common lunar surface compositions (e.g., mare and highlands soils and pyroclastic deposits), but surface compositions with reflectance properties that deviate strongly from these cases (e.g., pyroxene‐, olivine‐, or spinel‐rich locations with minimal space weathering) may require the use of more sophisticated thermal correction models or overlapping Diviner temperature estimates.

abstract = {Abstract A three-dimensional (3D) finite element model was built to understand the lunar surface and subsurface thermophysical behavior. This is a multi-layer model, with a top porous layer followed by denser layer(s) beneath, with several advantages. The model can incorporate complex geometry, different sizes and parametric-based variation in physical properties for individual layers and can be implemented at various scales. At present, the model can account for local to regional scale variations and can be improved further to predict global scale variations. The diurnal evolution of surface and subsurface temperatures from the model showed a clear effect of the outermost porous layer on the heat propagation into the subsurface as predicted from earlier studies. Being a 3D model, it is capable of simulating significant variations in lateral heat transport due to presence of topography to derive realistic surface and near-surface temperatures on the Moon. The model results were validated through laboratory experiments, Apollo in situ data and compared with those from earlier models. The unique feature of the model is that it allows to use any Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for any site of interest which is demonstrated in this work by considering a case study of the Apollo-17 landing site to derive its thermophysical behavior. In addition to being an important tool for addressing several geophysical problems, the model can largely aid in planning and execution of future in situ exploration of the Moon. This model is a first step toward building a comprehensive large-scale model for understanding the thermophysical behavior of the Moon.},
